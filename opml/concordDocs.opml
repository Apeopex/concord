				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.fargo.io/outlinerHowto&quot;&gt;An outliner&lt;/a&gt; is a text editor that organizes information in a hierarchy, allowing users to control the level of detail and to reorganize according to structure. Your notes can have full detail, yet be organized so a casual reader can get a quick overview. Outlining is a great way for teams to organize work.

				<outline text="The GPL is the right license for our goals. We want to encourage developers to add features compatibly, so that documents open and can be edited in all environments. If commercial developers want to add private features to the outliner, we will try to work with them, we just want to be sure we can have a conversation about compatibility, and perhaps create revenue to fund development. If a non-commercial project emerges that breaks compatibilty, because the GPL is used, we will have the option of bringing their work into compatibility. "/>
