### Concord is an outliner

[An outliner](http://docs.fargo.io/outlinerHowto) is a text editor that organizes information in a hierarchy, allowing users to control the level of detail and to reorganize according to structure. Your notes can have full detail, yet be organized so a casual reader can get a quick overview. Outlining is a great way for teams to organize work. 


### Written in JavaScript

It's a jQuery plug-in that implements a full-featured outliner that you can drop into other applications with a minimum of work. 


### It's the core of Fargo

[Fargo](http://fargo.io/) is our browser-based outliner that hooks into Dropbox. 
Concord is the outlining engine in Fargo.


### GPL-licensed

[Concord] (https://github.com/scripting/concord) is licensed under the GPL because outliners are an incredibly useful way to edit structured information, and we want Concord to be able to fill every conceivable niche that an outliner can help. 


### Example 1: Hello Outliner

The hello world of outliners.
A single frame that saves OPML text into local storage. 
A menu that allows you to open  Concord source code, CSS, sample code, docs. 


### Ideas for outliners

It would be great to have an outliner embedded in a WordPress editing front-end. One headline for every post in a site, under it, the content of the post.
